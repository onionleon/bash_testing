# bash_testing
Automated bash script that can be used to test .sh files

Usage: create a stem file where you have all of the steams of the .in, .expect and .args files
if your .sh script doesn't require a .in file or a . args file you can call the program without 
those arguments

It automatically checks, if your scipt requires input or command line arguments
